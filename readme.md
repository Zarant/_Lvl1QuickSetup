## How to use

Log on a level 1 character, setup your UI and then type `/run saveAll()` on the chat box, the next time you create a level 1 character of that same class the addon will attempt to restore your character specific macros, keybinds and action bars. 

Make sure to edit the file `ConsoleVariables.lua` with a text editor since it contain settings specific to your interface setup.
